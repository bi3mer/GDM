#  Graph-based Sequential Decision Making (GSDM)

The goal of this library is to provide out of the box active and passive reinforcement learning algorithms that are easy to use. The work on your part is to define your problem as a [networkx directed graph](https://networkx.org/documentation/stable/reference/classes/digraph.html) and the library takes care of the rest. I plan to implement several examples, including the oh so famous Grid World after finishing up the core implementation.
