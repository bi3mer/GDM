#  Graph-based Sequential Decision Making (GSDM)

The goal of this library is to provide out of the box active and passive reinforcement learning algorithms that are easy to use. The work on your part is to define your problem as a graph and the library will take care of the rest. I plan to implement several examples, including the oh so famous Grid World a little bit later.
